    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Cortez Coins and Collectibles was previously owned by Fred Vandergraff and his son Fred Vandergraff Jr.
      They were both loved members of the community. Eric originally met the Vandergraffâ€™s at the Manatee Coin club
      and after almost 40 years, Fred Jr and Eric became business partners. After 5 great years, Fred Jr tragically
      passed at his home in Ellenton, FL and Eric bought the Cortez Coins & Collectibles Bradenton location and has
      been carrying on their legacy ever since.</p>

    <h3>Clubs</h3>
    <p>Eric has been a part of the Manatee Coin club since 1979, just two years after he first started collecting.
      Within that time frame, in later years, he has held the positions of secretary for 4 years, treasurer for 2,
      and he has been the President of the Manatee Coin club for over 11 years and counting. However, his
      participation in the community does not stop there. Eric has also been an officer of the Sarasota Coin club
      for over 5 years, holding the position of secretary and treasurer, and he is also an active member of the
      Venice Coin club. If you are interested in learning more about the clubs or how to participate, we will be
      more than happy to share any information on how to become more involved in the community.</p>
